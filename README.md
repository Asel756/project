Project Description: Password Generator
This project creates a simple Java program that generates secure passwords based on user preferences.
It allows users to choose the length and types of characters they want in their password, such as lowercase
letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The program then checks how strong the password is.
Features:
1.	Customizable Password:
Users can set:
o	The minimum and maximum length of the password.
o	Which types of characters to include (letters, numbers, symbols).
2.	Password Generation:
The program generates a random password using the selected characters.
3.	Strength Check:
After generating the password, the program checks its strength and gives a score (like "weak" or "strong").
Technologies Used:
•	Java: The programming language used for the project.
•	Scanner Class: For taking user input.
•	Random Class: For picking characters randomly.
•	External Library (optional): For checking password strength (e.g., zxcvbn).
Challenges:
•	Ensuring the password meets all user preferences.
•	Correctly evaluating password strength.
Conclusion:
This tool helps users create secure passwords by giving them control over the password's length and character types, while also showing how strong the password is.
